<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the College of Artificial Intelligence at Nankai University and the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of [Prof. Jing Xu](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/info/1033/3528.htm) and [Prof. Ping Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~pinli/). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the School of Physics at Nankai University.

My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, with a particular focus on weakly supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and training-free methods. Currently, I am primarily focused on how to better transfer foundation models to downstream tasks, such as camouflaged object detection.

If you are interested in our work, feel free to contact me via email (1120230244@mail.nankai.edu.cn; polyuduji.du@connect.polyu.hk) or WeChat (XH_duji).
